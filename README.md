📌 Project Overview — Streamify (Video Player Website)
Your repository is a simple static video-player website built with HTML and CSS, hosted on GitHub Pages. It looks like a custom UI that mimics a streaming platform interface where users can browse videos.

The core of the project appears to be:

🗂 Main Files
1. index.html

This is the main webpage.

It contains static HTML markup that creates a video streaming interface — with UI elements like:

Search bar

Voice search option

Upload button

Navigation menu (Home, Trending, Subscriptions, Originals, Saved)

A grid/list of video thumbnails (embedded YouTube links)

The embedded video content is likely displayed using <iframe> elements pointing to YouTube videos.

This makes it function like a basic front-end for browsing and watching video content in a YouTube-style layout. There is no database or backend logic present — it’s purely a front-end static site.

2. styles/ Directory

This contains stylesheet files (CSS) used to style the HTML elements.

It defines layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive behavior of the UI components you built.

3. thumbnails/, icons/, etc.

These folders contain static image assets:

Video thumbnails shown on the page

Icons used for UI buttons (search, voice, upload, profile)

Channel pictures and other decorative assets
